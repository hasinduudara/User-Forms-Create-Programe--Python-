# ðŸ™‚ User Data Collection Tool

This is a simple Python terminal tool designed to collect user information (name, email, age) and save it into individual text files within a dedicated `user_files` directory.

## Features

*   **User Input:** Prompts the user to enter their name, email, and age.
*   **Dynamic Filenames:** Generates a unique filename for each user based on their name (e.g., `john_doe_data.txt`).
*   **Organized Storage:** Automatically creates a `user_files` directory if it doesn't exist and stores all user data files within it.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error handling for file operations.

## How to Run

1.  **Save the script:** Save the Python code as `main.py` (or any other `.py` filename you prefer).
2.  **Open your terminal/command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the `main.py` file.
3.  **Execute the script:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
